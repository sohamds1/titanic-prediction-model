# titanic-prediction-model
This project uses linear regression to predict the outcome of the titanic data set of whether a passenger survived or not, given the data set. 

A simple yet crisp description of Logistic Description would be, â€œit is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes."
 
All the requirements for this project can be installed accordingly with the command: 
> pip install -r requirements.txt 

The graph of logistic regression is as shown below:

The server is run on Flask, hence the installation of Flask is required along with all the libraries.
